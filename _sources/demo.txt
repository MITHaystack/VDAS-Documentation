Demonstrations
==============

On Monday, October 24th, 2011 a two antenna, a successful 16 Gbps experiment
was run between Westford Radio Telescope
`Westford <http://www.haystack.mit.edu/obs/westford/history.html>`_
 in Westford, MA, and the 
`Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory (GGAO)
<http://cddis.nasa.gov/ggao/>`_ Radio Telescope in Greenbelt, MD.

The successful demonstration was the result of a lot of hard work from 
folks at 
`MIT Haystack Observatory <http://www.haystack.mit.edu/>`_ and
`NASA Goddard Space Flight Center High End
Computer Network Team <http://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/606.1/HECN.html>`_.

Results
-------

Figures 1 through 3 show the results of the 16 Gbps demonstration.

  **Figure 1:** Average receive bit rate versus time for each of the four
  10 GE interfaces on the Mark6 VDAS. Each interface maintains
  4 Gbps for the duration fo the 43 second scan.

  **Figure 2:** Average write bit rate versus time for each of the four
  8-disk modules on the Mark6 VDAS. Each interface maintains
  4 Gbps for the duration fo the 43 second scan.
